1. Describe your experience using AI while completing this project.

Working with AI on this project was a combination of efficiency, guidance, and learning support. I used ChatGPT both as a coding assistant and as a conceptual reference when I needed clarification on formulas, class relationships, or best practices. Instead of writing every class from scratch, I used AI to generate skeleton classes, JavaDoc comments, and template designs for the shape hierarchy. This allowed me to focus more on understanding the logic rather than getting stuck on boilerplate structure. I also used AI to help create JUnit tests that follow good testing patterns. Throughout the process, I treated AI output as a starting point rather than a final answer reviewing formulas, fixing formatting, modifying comments, renaming variables, and ensuring everything matched my instructor’s requirements. Overall, AI helped streamline the assignment while still giving me full control over the final code.

2. Discuss the benefits and limitations of using AI in this context.

One clear benefit of AI is speed generative tools can produce complete class structures and tests in seconds, which saves significant development time. AI also helped reduce cognitive overhead by generating clear examples of inheritance, polymorphism, and proper method overriding. Another benefit is learning reinforcement: AI explanations of formulas and object-oriented principles helped solidify concepts that I already understood but needed confirmation on. However, there are limitations. AI can generate errors, incorrect formulas, or code that does not fully align with assignment requirements. It also sometimes produces overly verbose or overly simplified examples. Because of this, I had to verify mathematical formulas myself and ensure that the code compiled properly with my project structure. The biggest limitation is that AI gives “plausible” answers that might look correct but still need human review. This project reinforced that AI should be treated as a tool, not a replacement for understanding.

3. Reflect on what you learned about inheritance and polymorphism during this project.

This project helped strengthen my understanding of inheritance by showing how an abstract class (Shape3D) can define shared behavior while allowing subclasses like Sphere, Cube, and Cylinder to implement their own formulas. I saw how powerful it is to centralize functionality such as getVolume() and getSurfaceArea() in the abstract class while delegating the exact formulas to the subclasses through abstract methods. This design made the hierarchy clean, reusable, and easy to extend especially when adding the custom shape (a Cone). Polymorphism became especially clear while writing and testing code that treated all shapes as Shape3D or ThreeDimensionalShape objects. Using streams to compare shapes by volume or surface area showed how objects of different types can still behave uniformly. The project made me more confident in designing class hierarchies and understanding how Java resolves overridden methods at runtime.

4. Would you use AI assistance in future programming assignments? Why or why not?

Yes, I would continue to use AI as long as I follow ethical guidelines and course policies. AI accelerates routine tasks such as writing boilerplate code, producing documentation, and setting up tests. It also serves as a helpful teaching partner when I need quick explanations or help debugging problems. That said, I would not rely on AI to “do the assignment for me” because that undermines my learning. The best way to use AI is as a supplement generating examples, explaining concepts, offering alternative solutions, or helping refactor code. This project showed that when used responsibly, AI can enhance both productivity and understanding. I plan to continue using it in a balanced way for brainstorming, verifying concepts, and improving my code quality in future assignments.
